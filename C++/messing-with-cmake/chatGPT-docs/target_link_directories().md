`target_link_directories()` is a CMake command that specifies the directories in which the linker should look for libraries when building a target. However, it's important to note that this command is generally not recommended for various reasons, and you should prefer using `target_link_libraries()` with full paths to libraries or use `find_library()` to locate libraries.

Here's an example of how `target_link_directories()` can be used:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

add_executable(MyExecutable main.cpp)

# Specify the directories where the linker should look for libraries
target_link_directories(MyExecutable PRIVATE /path/to/library_directory)

# Link the executable with a library named 'mylibrary'
target_link_libraries(MyExecutable PRIVATE mylibrary)
```

In this example:

- `target_link_directories()` is used to specify the directory (`/path/to/library_directory`) where the linker should look for libraries.

- `target_link_libraries()` is then used to link the executable (`MyExecutable`) with a library named `mylibrary`.

While this approach can work, it has some drawbacks and is not considered best practice for several reasons:

1. **Lack of Transparency:** Using `target_link_directories()` may make your CMakeLists.txt less transparent because it hides where the libraries are actually located. This can make the build less portable.

2. **Not Configurable:** It doesn't allow the build system to configure where libraries are located based on the build configuration or platform.

3. **Use of Full Paths is Preferred:** A preferred practice is to use full paths in `target_link_libraries()` or use `find_library()` to locate the library, making your build more explicit and portable.

Here is an alternative approach using `target_link_libraries()` with a full path:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

add_executable(MyExecutable main.cpp)

# Link the executable with a library using a full path
target_link_libraries(MyExecutable PRIVATE /path/to/library_directory/mylibrary)
```

Or, if you have multiple libraries:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

add_executable(MyExecutable main.cpp)

# Link the executable with multiple libraries using full paths
target_link_libraries(MyExecutable PRIVATE
    /path/to/library_directory/lib1
    /path/to/library_directory/lib2
    # Add more libraries as needed
)
```

This approach is more explicit and makes it clear where the libraries are located.
